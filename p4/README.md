# Week #4. Deep REID and Object Tracking

## Files description.

### `p4. lfw.ipynb`

This is the main `colab`-ready notebook containing the practical lessons code explained in the video lecture. This notebook is based on the [LFW dataset](http://vis-www.cs.umass.edu/lfw/).

Store it somewhere on your Google Drive to run without modifications via the [Google Colab](https://colab.research.google.com/) or modify correspondingly to run via the [Jupyter](https://jupyter.org/).

Please refer to the corresponding video for the usage details.

### `p4. cbcl.py`

Additional notebook for the [MIT-CBCL dataset](http://cbcl.mit.edu/software-datasets/heisele/facerecognition-database.html). It is briefly used during the lessons and you will need it to accomplish the final assessment. Store it in the same folder with the previous one.

Please refer to the corresponding video for the usage details.
