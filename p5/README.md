# Week #5. Image Segmentation

## Files description.

### `p5.ipynb`

This is a `colab`-ready notebook containing the practical lessons code. Store it somewhere on your Google Drive to run without modifications via the [Google Colab](https://colab.research.google.com/) or modify correspondingly to run via the [Jupyter](https://jupyter.org/).

This notebook consists of two sections: semantic segmentation based on Carvana Image Masking Challenge and instance segmentation based on The Northumberland Dolphin Dataset 2020.

Colab has only a small part of each dataset. If you want to train models on full dataset, download it by yourself: [Carvana Image Masking Challenge](https://www.kaggle.com/c/carvana-image-masking-challenge/data) and  [The Northumberland Dolphin Dataset 2020](https://data.ncl.ac.uk/collections/The_Northumberland_Dolphin_Dataset_2020/4982342/1)

Please refer to the corresponding lecture for the usage details.
